Welcome to the Texturant. How may I help you today?

Texturant is a Node.js command line interface app made to simulate what I think it would be like ordering food in a complete terminal environment.
It is constantly being updated, and new features will be coming soon. Stay updated!

# Installation
You can install Texturant with npm, with:

`npm install texturant --global`

That will install Texturant, and it will work no matter what directory you are in.


# Documentation
PS: Extra docs will be coming soon.


## Usage Example
Here is an example of how you can use Texturant, made by me.
