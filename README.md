Development version of Texturant.
If you want to use this version, you can wait for a working patch or do some coding yourself. Don't use this version unless you know how to fix problems you come by.
I will **not** be helping anyone using this version.

Anyway, here is some content of the original README.

`npm i -g texturant`
That is the command to install Texturant, a CLI made to simulate ordering food on a computer.

**Surprise Surprise, I made this because I was bored and wanted to code. Thank my boredom for this being a thing now :^)**
